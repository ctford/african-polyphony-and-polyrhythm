# African polyphony and polyrhythm

## Abstract
Ethnomusicologists face a dilemma: either shoehorn African music into European notation, or create custom DSLs that can only be understood by a select band of European ethnomusicologists. Algomusicologists can solve this problem, because we have principled ways of modelling specific idioms in terms of general computation. What's more, our models can be executed to generate actual music.

Simha Arom is a French-Israeli ethnomusicologist. In the book from which the title of this talk is borrowed, he describes the principles underlying the musical system of traditional central African polyphony and polyrhythm. Arom invented ingenious recording techniques for deconstructing and systematising musical cultures that had no previous tradition of musical theory. He tested his models by using them to recreate music and inviting central African musicians to critique the results.

This talk will argue that music-as-code is an ideal way to represent Arom's insights. I will show the full truth in the LÃ©vi-Strauss quote with which Arom prefaces his book: "The proof of the analysis is in the synthesis." Programming has played its part in the homogenisation of global culture, but the universality of the lambda calculus also affords a golden opportunity for code to become a point of interchange between formerly incompatible musical systems.

## Talk

### Arom's method
* Identify relevant features
* Create model
* Recreate original to validate model
* Recording system
* Show examples of his notation
* Western music originally notated pitch only

### Tuning systems
* Tuning and temperament
* Bartok's flats
* Pentatonic equal temperament in Uganda

### Polyrhythms
* Different bar lengths and stress
* Clapping music
* Infinite songs

### Variations
* Identifying the most basic form of a song
* Variations as extensions to internal DSL
* Timbre as a variation

### Moving the bias out one level
* Even the enterprise of analysing music this way is culturally determined
* The subjectivity of algorithms
* Falsehoods that programmers believe about music e.g. music and dance are separate
* Social functions of music

### Performance
* ???
