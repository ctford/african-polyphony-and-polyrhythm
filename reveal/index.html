                        * performance → score → performance
                        * performance → notation → representation → performance
                        * There can be one representation for many notations.
                        * Notations can use powerful abstractions, because they aren't directly executed.
                        * As programmers, we have sophisticated mechanisms for abstraction and composition, which lets achieve open world languages with a degree of mutual intelligibility.
